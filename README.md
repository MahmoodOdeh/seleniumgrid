selenium

Selenium is a popular open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It provides a suite of tools for web application testing across different browsers and platforms. Selenium WebDriver, the most common component of Selenium, allows users to write test scripts in programming languages like Java, Python, C#, etc., to automate interactions with web elements. It's widely used for testing web applications, automating repetitive tasks, and validating web applications across different browsers.

selenium grid

Selenium Grid is a part of the Selenium suite that allows you to run multiple Selenium tests in parallel across different browsers, operating systems, and machines. It acts as a hub that distributes test execution to multiple nodes (machines) running Selenium WebDriver. This helps in reducing the time taken to run tests, especially when you need to test your application across various configurations simultaneously. Selenium Grid supports both manual and automated test distribution.
